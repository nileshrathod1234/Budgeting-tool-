# Budgeting-tool-
 This project aims to create a simple yet effective budgeting tool using Python that helps users to track and manage their expenses. The tool provides a way to add expenses, view the total amount spent in a given category, and view the overall total spent. Additionally, the tool allows users to save and load their budget data using CSV files.
